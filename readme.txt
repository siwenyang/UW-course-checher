My web app is based on the uw course API.
It is responsive, since User get feedback from all loading wait and loading finish.
It use four main filters which is all accesible.

One is display all course info called "All Course".
One can be filtered by input course id, easy to find the unique course you want.
One can be filtered by input subject, all same subjects will show up, easy to compare the course from same faculty.
One can be filtered by range of catalog number,which is helpful user to choose course in the same grade. i.e.(1xx course for first year)

Also this web is designed to be suitable for both PC and Iphone6.
